# Java Probability Distributions Project
## This Java project visualizes the following probability distributions:

- Bernoulli Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Negative Binomial Distribution
- Geometric Distribution
- Hypergeometric Distribution
Each distribution is graphically represented to aid in understanding the probability theory behind these common statistical models.

## Features
- Clear and intuitive visual representations.
- Interactive input parameters for each distribution.
- Well-documented code for ease of understanding and modification.
